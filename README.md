# Basic Info
This is the tutorial for KIX3004: Python Programming  Semester 1 2023/2024

This Repository is just for sharing and my own documentation purpose.

I'll try to Upload each of the tutorials after my class.

Each of the weeks tutorial might need different package requirements, so I will list them down in their respective folders.

> Note: The Python Version I used is `3.10.x` .So take it into account when running the codes. ~~(Though I don't think there will be much problem)~~
