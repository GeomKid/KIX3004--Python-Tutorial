# Basic Info
This Tutorial is about creating a GUI using QT5 Designer

The [UI file](problem_1.ui) is created by using the QT Designer.
After Creating it you use `pyuic5 -x problem_1.ui -o ui_file.py` to create the [python file](ui_file.py) that have all UI information.
I coded all UI logic in [this file](problem_1.py) by using inheritance.

To preview how the UI looks like run `python ui_file.py`
To use the whole UI with all logic run `python problem_1.py`
